rapidhash - Very fast, high quality, platform-independent
====

Family of three hash functions: rapidhash, rapidhashMicro and rapidhashNano

**Rapidhash**  
General purpose hash function, amazing performance across all sizes.  
Surpasses [70GB/s](https://github.com/Nicoshev/rapidhash/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#outstanding-performance) on Apple's M4 cpus.  
Clang-18+ compiles it to ~185 instructions, both on x86-64 and aarch64.  
The fastest recommended hash function by [SMHasher](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher?tab=readme-ov-file#summary) and [SMHasher3](https://gitlab.com/fwojcik/smhasher3/-/blob/main/results/README.md#passing-hashes).

**RapidhashMicro**  
Designed for HPC and server applications, where cache misses make a noticeable performance detriment.  
Clang-18+ compiles it to ~140 instructions without stack usage, both on x86-64 and aarch64.  
Faster for sizes up to 512 bytes, just 15%-20% slower for inputs above 1kb.  
Produces same output as Rapidhash for inputs up to 80 bytes.

**RapidhashNano**  
Designed for Mobile and embedded applications, where keeping a small code size is a top priority.  
Clang-18+ compiles it to less than 100 instructions without stack usage, both on x86-64 and aarch64.  
The fastest for sizes up to 48 bytes, but may be considerably slower for larger inputs.  
Produces same output as Rapidhash for inputs up to 48 bytes.

**Streamable**  
The three functions can be computed without knowing the input length upfront.

**Universal**  
All functions have been optimized for both AMD64 and AArch64 systems.  
Compatible with gcc, clang, icx and MSVC.  
They do not use machine-specific vectorized or cryptographic instruction sets.

**Excellent**  
All functions pass all tests in both [SMHasher](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher/blob/master/doc/rapidhash.txt) and [SMHasher3](https://gitlab.com/fwojcik/smhasher3/-/blob/main/results/raw/rapidhash.txt).  
[Collision-based study](https://github.com/Nicoshev/rapidhash/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#collision-based-hash-quality-study) showed a collision probability close to ideal.  
Outstanding collision ratio when tested with datasets of 16B and 67B keys:

| ---  | ---   | ---   | --- |
|   12 | 15 Gi |   7.0 |   6 |

Long-input measurements were taken compiling with the RAPIDHASH_UNROLLED macro.

Collision-based hash quality study
-------------------------

A perfect hash function distributes its domain uniformly onto the image.  
When the domain's cardinality is a multiple of the image's cardinality, each potential output has the same probability of being produced.  
A function producing 64-bit hashes should have a $p=1/2^{64}$ of generating each output.

If we compute $n$ hashes, the expected amount of collisions should be the number of unique input pairs times the probability of producing a given hash.  
This should be $(n*(n-1))/2 * 1/2^{64}$, or simplified: $(n*(n-1))/2^{65}$.  
In the case of hashing $15*2^{30}$ (~16.1B) different keys, we should expect to see $7.03$ collisions.

We present an experiment in which we use rapidhash to hash $68$ datasets of $15*2^{30}$ (15Gi) keys each.  
For each dataset, the amount of collisions produced is recorded as measurement.  
Ideally, the average among measurements should be $7.03$ and the results collection should be a binomial distribution.  
We obtained a mean value of $7.60$, just $8.11$% over $7.03$.  
Each dataset individual result and the collisions test program can be found in the [collisions folder](https://github.com/Nicoshev/rapidhash/tree/master/collisions).  
The default seed $0$ was used in all experiments.
